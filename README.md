# Fault Detection System using CNN

This repository contains the implementation of a fault detection system that detects and eliminates faulty products based on shape and color using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project is part of the GRIP (Graduate Rotational Internship Project) tasks for an IoT and Computer Vision Internship at The Sparks Foundation.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Caltech 101 dataset](https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02), which contains images of objects belonging to 101 categories. The images were collected from various sources and have varying backgrounds, orientations, and scales.

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

            git clone https://github.com/nadinejackson1/fault-detection-system.git

            cd fault-detection-system

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code for training and evaluating the CNN model on the Caltech 101 dataset.
